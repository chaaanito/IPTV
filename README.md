# IPTV WebApp

An IPTV web application built with Vite + Svelte, powered by DexieJS, PeerJS, and Video.js.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is a lightweight IPTV player with a built-in channel manager.
Itâ€™s designed to run seamlessly on devices like Android TV while letting you manage channels from another device â€” no cloud required.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

### Vite + Svelte

Fast, modern frontend development with Svelteâ€™s reactivity and Viteâ€™s blazing-fast bundling.

### Video.js

Used as the core player for smooth playback of HLS and DASH streams, with cross-platform compatibility.

### DexieJS

IndexedDB wrapper for local storage of channels â€” ensures your channel list stays available offline.

### PeerJS

Enables peer-to-peer communication between devices.
Example: Add or remove channels from your Android TVâ€™s IPTV app directly from your phone.

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

Local Backend Panel â€“ Accessible via QR code from the main screen.

Two-Way Sync â€“ Devices connected with PeerJS instantly share changes (additions/deletions) to the channel list.

## ðŸ¤” Why?

Becauseâ€¦ why not?
Itâ€™s fun, minimal, and gets the job done without bloated dependencies or heavy servers.
